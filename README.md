# AI-PacMan-Projects
Implemented various AI algorithms in Pac-Man projects developed by UC Berkeley. Implemented informed/blind state-space search using search algorithms like BFS, DFS, UCS and A* algorithm with heuristic calculation. Designed an algorithm for reflex agent, minimax and alpha-beta pruning. Reinforcement Learning using MDP (Value Iteration and Policy Evaluation) - Implemented Markov Decision process using Value iteration in the Pacman World. Designed perceptron classifier for data classification. Developed applications using python. http://ai.berkeley.edu/project_overview.html
